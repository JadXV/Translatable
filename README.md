## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Distinction from Hackathon Version

> üõ†Ô∏è **Note:** This is **not** the same version that won **StackHacks**.

**Translatable X / v10.0** is a **simplified, completely rewritten version** of the original **Translatable** that was presented at StackHacks. While the original version was more complex and tailored for a competitive hackathon environment, **this version focuses on clarity, ease of use, and performance.** It has been rebuilt from scratch using **Python** to ensure it's lightweight, maintainable, and easy to deploy.

Key differences:

* **Rewritten in Python** (vs. older tech stack)
* **Streamlined core features** for easier setup and better performance
* **More maintainable and beginner-friendly**

This makes **Translatable X** ideal for personal projects, small teams, or educational use‚Äîwithout sacrificing its core mission of breaking down language barriers.
