## ⚠️ Clarification: This Is Not the Hackathon Version

> 🛠️ **Note:** You can still use the original and bigger version used for the Hackathon, it's located in the `HackathonTranslatable` folder — it required bridging multiple programming languages as per the event rules.

**Translatable X / v10.0** is a **complete rewrite** of that version. It’s intentionally **smaller, simpler, and cleaner** to prioritize clarity, speed, and ease of use — hence the difference in size and complexity.

Key differences:

* ✅ **Fully rewritten in Python** (vs. mixed-language tech stack)
* ⚡ **Streamlined features** for better performance
* 🧠 **More maintainable and beginner-friendly**
