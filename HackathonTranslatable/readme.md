# Translatable - HACKATHON(OLD) (New version available)

This version of Translatable is for StackHacks 2024. If you'd just like to use the best available Translatable use main.py in the parent directory.

Hello and welcome to Translatable. This bot automatically translates server members messages if they are not in English.
Users can also reply to translated messages to automatically translate their reply in the language of the user who sent the original message!

## Purpose

Translatable serves as an informative and educational tool. It helps users understand messages in languages they might not be familiar with, promoting inclusivity and connection within Discord communities. Users that speak other languages can not only be understood but can also understand the replies of fellow members.

## Components

Translatable is primarily built using two programming languages:
- **Python**: Handles translations and language detection.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the bot functionality within Discord.

## Requirements

### Node.js
- **Discord.js v12**: Exact version required. Install using: `npm i discord.js@12`
- **EmojiRegex**: Install using: `npm install emoji-regex`

### Python
- **googletrans 4.0.0 RC1**: Exact version required. Install using: `pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1`

### Discord
The bot must have the following intents enabled:
- Presence Intent
- Server Members Intent
- Message Content Intent

## Usage

To run the bot, simply execute `main.js`. There's no need to interact directly with the Python script; it handles everything automatically.

## Note

- The bot is primarily designed for Windows, but it may also work on other platforms.
Feel free to reach out for questions or assistance.
